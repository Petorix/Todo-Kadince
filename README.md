# Todo-Kadince

Requested project:

- Developed using the MERN stack
- Deployed using Heroku
- Designed using react-bootstrap

Note: I was on the fence about adding additional functionality (to show what I can do) and sticking to the business requirement. I decided to stick to the business requirement as I wasn't sure if avoiding scope creep was part of the test. I did, however, set it up to easily add any extra components by initializing a routing system with which any extra pages could be added.
